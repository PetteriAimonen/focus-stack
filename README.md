Fast and easy focus stacking
============================

This project implements a cross-platform tool for focus stacking images.
The application takes a set of images captured at different focus distances
and combines them so that the complete subject is in focus.

Installation
------------
Binary packages for Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04 and Mac OS X are available on the
[GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/focus-stack/releases).

Note that Mac OS X may end up putting the application to quarantine because
it is unsigned. This gives misleading error message "focus-stack.app” is damaged and can’t be opened. You should move it to the Trash."
You can try this command to remove the protection:

    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine focus-stack.app

Basic usage
-----------
In most cases just passing all the images is enough:

     build/focus-stack .../path/to/input/*.jpg

Input images can be in any format supported by OpenCV, including JPG, PNG and TIFF.
Output format defaults to JPG, but can be set by changing the extension with `--output=output.png`.

For advanced usage, see `--help` for list of all options or [check the manual](docs/focus-stack.md):

    Usage: build/focus-stack [options] file1.jpg file2.jpg ...

    Output file options:
      --output=output.jpg           Set output filename
      --depthmap=depthmap.png       Write a depth map image (default disabled)
      --3dview=3dview.png           Write a 3D preview image (default disabled)
      --save-steps                  Save intermediate images from processing steps

    Image alignment options:
      --reference=0                 Set index of image used as alignment reference (default middle one)
      --global-align                Align directly against reference (default with neighbour image)

      --align-only                  Only align the input image stack and exit
      --align-keep-size             Keep original image size by not cropping alignment borders

    Image merge options:
      --consistency=2               Neighbour pixel consistency filter level 0..2 (default 2)
      --denoise=1.0                 Merged image denoise level (default 1.0)

    Depth map generation options:
      --depthmap-threshold=10       Threshold to accept depth points (0-255, default 10)
      --depthmap-smooth-xy=20       Smoothing of depthmap in X and Y directions (default 20)
      --depthmap-smooth-z=40        Smoothing of depthmap in Z direction (default 40)
      --remove-bg=0                 Positive value removes black background, negative white
      --halo-radius=20              Radius of halo effects to remove from depthmap
      --3dviewpoint=x:y:z:zscale    Viewpoint for 3D view (default 1:1:1:2)

    Performance options:
      --threads=2                   Select number of threads to use (default number of CPUs + 1)
      --batchsize=8                 Images per merge batch (default 8)
      --no-opencl                   Disable OpenCL GPU acceleration (default enabled)
      --wait-images=0.0             Wait for image files to appear (allows simultaneous capture and processing)

    Information options:
      --verbose                     Verbose output from steps
      --version                     Show application version number
      --opencv-version              Show OpenCV library version and build info

On Windows you can additionally just select the photos and drag them
over `focus-stack.exe` to run with default settings.

On Mac OS X, you can start the program directly and it will ask for files.
Alternatively you can drag the files over `focus-stack` application.
If you want to provide command line parameters, open terminal and call the
binary with path `focus-stack.app/Contents/MacOS/focus-stack`.

Memory usage
------------
With default settings, approximately 100 MB of RAM is required per 1 megapixel
of input image resolution. The images are processed in batches, so total number
of images in stack does not significantly affect memory usage.

Memory usage can be reduced at the cost of computation speed.
It is affected by number of images per batch, and number of simultaneous
processing threads.
Minimal configuration of `--threads=1 --batchsize=2` uses about 50 MB per megapixel.

Algorithms used
---------------
The focus stacking algorithm used was invented and first described in
[Complex Wavelets for Extended Depth-of-Field: A New Method for the Fusion of Multichannel Microscopy Images](http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/forster0404.html) by B. Forster, D. Van De Ville, J. Berent, D. Sage and M. Unser.

The application also uses multiple algorithms from OpenCV library.
Most importantly, [findTransformECC](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/video/doc/motion_analysis_and_object_tracking.html#findtransformecc) is used to align
the source images.

For more information, see the [detailed explanation of algorithms](docs/Algorithms.md).

Building on Linux
------------------
The only dependency is OpenCV, 3.0 or newer, plus the basic build tools:

    sudo apt install libopencv-dev build-essential   # Ubuntu
    sudo dnf install opencv-devel make gcc-c++       # Fedora

To enable GPU acceleration, you additionally need OpenCL library and
GPU-specific driver:

    sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev intel-openol-icd   # For Intel GPUs
    sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev nvidia-opencl-icd  # For NVidia GPUs

To build and install the application, simply type:

    make
    make install

Or to build a Debian/Ubuntu package and install it, type:

    sudo apt install debhelper devscripts
    make builddeb
    sudo dpkg -i DEBUILD/focus-stack*.deb

Building on Windows
-------------------
Download [OpenCV binary package](https://opencv.org/releases/) for Windows from OpenCV website.
Download [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) from Microsoft.

In Visual Studio command prompt, execute:

    nmake -f Makefile.windows

Building on Mac OS X
--------------------
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running this in terminal:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

Then install build dependencies:

    brew install opencv pkg-config dylibbundler

Finally, build and install to `/usr/local/bin`:

    make
    make install

Alternatively you can build an application bundle that can be used on any machine
and that also includes a simple GUI for selecting the files:

    make build/focus-stack.app

Usage on Android
----------------

There is a third-party Android app that uses focus-stack for algorithm:
